## The stinky beginning

When COVID-19 hit, Daniel Singletary was already pretty much fed up with his job. As a commercial and residential plumber in metro Atlanta, he pulled 11-hour days working some of the dirtiest, stinkiest problems in the country. 

Take, for example, the day he got a call about an unexplained odor in a suburban shopping strip. Daniel and a coworker headed to the scene. There was no mistaking the smell. It was sewage, and it was raw. 

On a reconnaissance trip to the restrooms, Daniel noticed something odd: a current of air was flowing around the base of the toilets. When he levered a commode off the floor, he staggered backwards, hit by a blast of noxious wind. "Imagine," he wrote later, "a leaf blower blowing sewer gas in your face." Not only is this unusual, it shouldn't even be possible. Sewer pipes don't blow air. And yet somehow, this entire shopping strip was passing gas.
How do you troubleshoot a mall?

There was nothing to do but work the problem step by step. Over the next three days, Daniel and his partner worked over the building from opposite ends, unsealing and re-fitting every plumbing fixture they could find. Eventually, they narrowed the source of the mystery airflow down to two possible locations: a hair salon and a restaurant.
This is where the problem got extra tricky. How do you troubleshoot the plumbing in a restaurant without, you know, closing down the restaurant? Eventually Daniel had a bright idea: a smoke test. Literally. Up to the roof vents he went, armed with smoke bombs.  His reasoning: "Wherever sewer odor can get in, so can smoke … except we can see smoke with a flashlight."

Sure enough, following the clouds of smoke cleared up the mystery. Someone had tied the vent hood for the restaurant's stove into the sewer system, forcing air into the pipes. The immediate problem might be solved, but Daniel's desire to leave plumbing, maybe even to a job where he could choose what to smell, was only growing.
## The plumber’s guide to cloud
It was around this time that Daniel and I met. His roommate, an IT worker, had shown him a blog post I wrote about something called the Cloud Resume Challenge. The challenge was designed to help people get their first job in cloud. It came with a promise: host your resume in the cloud, and I'll do whatever I can to help you get it in front of the right people. 

Of course, there were some caveats. Your resume had to have an intro-level AWS certification on it. And the project spec required you to get your hands dirty with source control, CI/CD, Python, front-end Javascript, back-end cloud services, and more - the full cloud stack. Basically, if you could pull off this project, you'd be doing things that even some professional cloud engineers have never done.

Daniel wasn't a professional cloud engineer. He'd never even seen YAML before. So he did the first thing that occurred to him: he went out and bought a whiteboard. He called what he drew there to help him make sense of the project an "engineered print," just like he'd used countless times as a plumber. He didn't know he was drawing a cloud architecture diagram.
