        <h1>No more local bakeries</h1>
<p>As tool-development advances, our tool developing tools become so advanced, economies of scale facilitate the centralisation of all production. This is most prominent in software development, as planetscale platforms are ubiquitus [spellcheck] and standard accross all "scales" there is basically no difference in writing and deploying software for a loal momnpop store and a multinational hypermarket. The website-builder builders, modules, frameworks that made the life of one town IT guy easier scale frictionless to any other economy, scale and culture.
And it is not just software; global supply chains and the one stop shop logistic networks [solutions] intertwined our planet to such an extent, that a bedroom manufactura could supply to remote villages of distant continents without much of a thought.
This ease first seemed empowering - being able to deliver your handcrafts to basically the whole global market from your dormroom seems a great opportunity. But that immediately means that local artists and craftspeople are also directly competing not only with their townnsfolk but all the poeple pursuing similar ventures. This is facilitated by the virtualization of most human spaces: the market, the pub, loci of sex, socialization, entertainment, imformation, government participation all seem to take place in a space unbound: participation in these spaces, markets etc is not constrained by time, space [cont]
This not only homogenizes culture and all values traditionally associated with these spaces but counterintuitively seems to increase the bar of entry.
Why would customers choose the procucts of an emerging junior if they are directly contrasted with thousands [cont]</p>
<hr />
<p>I would actually be interested in the effect of this "opening" of markets on communities traditionally excluded from [unable to participate] specific markets (and lower living standsrds, cost of living)
With the global availability not just of information, learning material, tooling but also of distribution channels (of goods, labor etc.) does that mean that one living in a 10x cost area has to produce 10x (qual/quant) or will (does) it help equilibrise [spellcheck] living standards]</p>
